> To have a good relationship, you have to be your whole self and care about each of the people who work for you as a human being. It is not just business: it is personal. and deeply personal. I call this dimension "Care Personally".
>
> THe second dimension involves telling people when their work isn't good enough ... Challenging people generally pisses them off... and yet challenging people is often the best way to show them that you care when you're the boss. This dimension I call "Challenge Directly".

> the "Get Stuff Done" (GSD) wheel:
>
> Listen => Clarify => Debate => Decide => Persuade => Execute => Learn => Listen

> If quiet listening involves being silent to give people room to talk, loud listening is about saying things intended to get a reaction out of them.

> create a culture of listening
>
> 0. have a simple system for employees to use to generate ideas and voice complaints.
> 1. make sure that at least some of the issues raised are quickly addressed
> 2. regularly offer explanations as to why the other issues aren't being addressed.

> Sometimes creating a culture of listening is simply a matter of managing meetings the right way ... "give the quiet ones a voice".

> push yourself and your direct reports to understand and convey thoughts and ideas more clearly

> Georgia O'Keeffe said, "It is only by selection, by elimination, and by emphasis that we get at the real meaning of things."

> [staff meeting] an effective staff meeting has three goals: it reviews how things have gone the previous week, allows people to share important updates, and forces the team to clarify the most important decisions and debates for the coming week

> when a team debated, both the ideas and the people came out more beautiful -- results well worth all the friction and noise

> make sure that individual egos and self-interest don't get in the way of an objective quest for the best answer.

> that is why kick-ass bosses often do not decide themselves, but rather create a clear decision-making process that empowerers people closest to the facts to make as many decisions as possible.

> make people feel free at work is to relinquish unilateral authority

> The basic premise here is that when everyone on your team is able to bring the best of what they've got mentally, emotionally, and physically to their work, they are more fulfilled in their jobs, they work better with one another, and the team bets better results.

> When you encourage people to criticize you publicly, you get the chance to show your team that you really, genuinely want the criticism. You also set an ideal for the team as a whole: everyone should embrace criticism that help us do our jobs better.
> praise in public, criticize in private

> a slight modification if you're talking to your boss instead of your employee -- ask permission to give guidance.
