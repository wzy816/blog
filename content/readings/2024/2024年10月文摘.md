## [AI #84: Better Than a Podcast](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2024/10/03/ai-84-better-than-a-podcast)

> My strong guess is that doctors learn various techniques that are ‘theoretically unsound’ in terms of their logic, or that take into account things that are ‘not supposed to matter’ but that do correlate with the right answer.

> I think that, today, an average 16 year old would learn better at home with an AI tutor than at a typical school, even if that ‘AI tutor’ was simply access to AIs like Gemini, NotebookLM, Claude and ChatGPT plus an AI coding assistant.

> OpenAI planning to convert to a for-profit B-corporation is a transparent betrayal of the mission of the OpenAI non-profit. It is a clear theft of resources, a clear break of the fiduciary duties of the new OpenAI board.

> It’s hard to do both at the same time—product-first culture is very different from research culture. You have to attract different kinds of talent. And maybe you’re building a different kind of company.

> \[Unlike the telephone, or electricity, where you can assume it’s probably going to work out okay\] I contend that ASI is more like the moon rocket. “The moon is small compared with the rest of the sky, so you don’t get to the moon by default – you hit some part of the sky that isn’t the moon. So, show me the plan by which you predict to specifically hit the moon.”

> – “Unretrievability”, more fully “Murphy’s Curse of Unretrievability”, is what makes it Very Hard to build space probes.
> — I tried calling this property “oneshotness”, but people motivatedly misinterpreted it to say, “It’s not ‘one-shot’, we can run tests first!”
> – The reason why running ground tests doesn’t make space probes not be Murphy-Cursed (i.e. building space probes is still a Big Huge Deal, and even then often fails in practice) is that conditions on the ground experiments are not exactly like conditions in space.

## [The real data wall is billions of years of evolution](https://dynomight.net/data-wall/)

> Every day, an average person reads a few thousand words, and hears perhaps 16 to 40 thousand. So a well-educated 40-year old might have encountered 5×10⁸ words in their lifetime. Recent language models are trained on upwards of 10¹² words—20,000 times more. It’s not even close.

## [A company is a language](https://world.hey.com/jason/a-company-is-a-language-66517a62)

> at the executive level, the linguistic demands intensify. You’re quickly expected to be a proficient speaker. To know the rules, grammar (and the esoteric exceptions), phonetics, intonation, semantics, and even the non-verbal cues that influence how someone else understands what you’re trying to communicate. It’s a tall order to learn a company — a language — quickly.

## [竹子必须是高洁的吗？](https://lenciel.com/2024/09/just-feel-the-joy-of-deep-thinking/)

> 学习这件事，除非是扒开脑子往里灌（实际上那叫洗脑不叫学习），就应该有讨论。

> 在「现代」社会里，科学范畴的讨论，应该主要看「正确不正确」，人文范畴的讨论，应该主要看「美好不美好」。

> 地球上能容下知识分子的地方，曾经总体上是一直在变大的。当年罗素出了本书叫《婚姻与道德》，里面对同性恋和开放婚姻有些超越那个时代的观点，因此被开除了教职，只好走穴。后来他这本书拿了诺奖，可见很多事需要个过程。所以卡伦·霍妮说现代人类学最大的贡献之一，就是不断扩大「正常人」的范围。

## [Three Subtle Examples of Data Leakage](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rzyHbLZHuqHq6KM65/three-subtle-examples-of-data-leakage)

> Data Leakage (n.): The use of information during Training and/or Evaluation which wouldn't be available in Deployment.

> If you make a model predicting a response from other factors, but feed it a dataset excluding responses over a certain ceiling, it'll tend to underestimate, especially near the cutoff point; however, if you then test it on a dataset excluding the same rows, it'll look like it's overestimating, since it's missing the rows it would underestimate.

> Context drift between training and deployment was small enough to be negligible, the ideal hyperparameters were the same regardless of what I did, and maintaining a strict arrow of time wasn't worth the trouble of changing the company's processes or the inconvenience of not being able to use conventional cross-validation. I was chastened by this result . . . . . . until I looked into performance of chronological vs random splits on their how-much-will-this-lot-cost-us datasets, and found that chronological splits were meaningfully better there.

## CEO 眼里的职业规划 by 局破 in 小红书

> 劳动力杠杆，资本杠杆，媒体或产品杠杆，你起码要能够用到其中一种。

## [Struggling like a Shadowmoth](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hvj9NGodhva9pKGTj/struggling-like-a-shadowmoth)

> a shadowmoth is a life form native to Coruscant. They're silicon-based, their wingflutes make music once they leave the cocoon and can fly."
> She nods, and says "Once, I saw a shadowmoth in its cocoon, struggling. Like you, I am sensitive to the force – I didn't merely empathize with it, but I felt it. When shadowmoths strive to break free from their cocoon, they are in pain. I felt it's pain. And I felt it's envy of the other moths, already free, flying, making music. I wanted to help it."

> for problems we don't understand yet, there may just not be an established field to learn from.
> There, you need the skill of either inventing new skills, or connecting dots between disparate existing fields that nobody has yet integrated. I think you need some kind of generalized research taste, that tells you what to do when nobody in the world is capable of authoritatively giving you the answer

> I think there is some art to being "exactly the right amount of cryptic and annoying", and to finding problems that form a reasonable difficulty curve for people with various different starting skills.

## [当我在走路时，我在想些什么？](https://memozine.me/2024/06/11/what-am-i-thinking-about-while-i-am-walking)

> 徒步而行让每件事都可以串联在一起，因为只在行走时，一个人可以活在整个世界中，而不只是分割出的一个个小小世界中。

## [When To Do What You Love](https://www.paulgraham.com/when.html)

> If you want to make a really huge amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars — it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent way to discover startup ideas.

## [The Deutsch Files I](https://nav.al/deutsch-files-i)

> the formula for great science fiction is supposed to be: you invent a fictional piece of science and then you explore the ramifications of it, both in science and in society. \

> ChatGPT ... They don’t understand what they themselves have just said. They certainly don’t understand what the human says to them. It’s a chatbot. It’s responding to prompts. That’s what it’s doing.

> Creativity and knowledge and explanation are all fundamentally impossible to define, because once you have defined them, then you can set up a formal system in which they are then confined.

> I find it better at extrapolation than synthesis. And extrapolation seems to be what a lot of society does. You have to write a newspaper column of 2500 words, so you extrapolate. You have to write a midterm paper, so you extrapolate. And so adding words is easy, but synthesizing, reducing, coming to the core of it, I think, is very difficult.

> we’re 5-10 years away from AGI. ... And then 5-10 years after that, we get ASI

## [General Intelligence (2024)](https://nonint.com/2024/06/03/general-intelligence-2024/)

> First, you seed your agent with one or more objectives. Have the agent use system 2 thinking in conjunction with its world model to start ideating ways to optimize for its objectives. It picks the best idea and builds a plan. It uses this plan to take an action on the world. It observes the result of this action and compares that result with the expectation it had based on its world model. It might update its world model here with the new knowledge gained. It uses system 2 thinking to make alterations to the plan (or idea). Rinse and repeat.
>
> My definition for general intelligence is an agent that can coherently execute the above cycle repeatedly over long periods of time, thereby being able to attempt to optimize any objective.

> I also suspect that robustness can be further improved via the interaction of system 2 thinking and observing the real world.

## [Nobody wants to use any software](https://www.characterworks.co/blog/nobody-wants-to-use-any-software)

> If it's the right kind of product and we can give them a moment of delight or joy—rather than take their time to do a little attention-seeking interaction dance—that's great. But mostly our job is to get them to not care at all about the product because it's just a thing that does a thing. They should not have to waste their one wild and precious life getting mad at that thing. Even if I’m building a login flow, the goal is to help them log out again as quickly as possible.
>
> And that's because of this thing that I also believe, and exists in permanent tension with the "just f\*cking computers" idea, which is that nobody wants to use any software, ever.

## [Why do programmers need private offices with doors?](https://shenisha.substack.com/p/why-do-programmers-need-private-offices)

> These two types of work were first identified, to my knowledge, by the programmer and essayist Paul Graham. The first type of work he describes can be interrupted harmlessly—nothing is lost if you stop for a second (or an hour, or a day) and come back to it later.
>
> The second type of work, however, is a completely different matter. The second type of work is like building our arch: If you stop for even an instant, you might drop half the pieces, drop the knowledge you were slowly accumulating of the strong points and weak points and which blocks go where.

## [生命的意义：虚无主义与精神疾病](https://prologue.dev/blog/the-meaning-of-life-nihilism-and-mental-illness)

> 虚无主义使得人类感到世界没有存在的意义、目标、可理解的真相和本质价值，也可以看作是对权威、道德和社会秩序的选择性拒绝

> Peter Wessel Zapffe 在《最后的救世主》对精神疾病提出提问：既然人类的痛苦来源于智力，为什么人类没有灭亡？答案是人类对于维持精神层面的生存有着自发的心理防御机制，有以下四种方式：
>
> 隔离，将令人不安和破坏性的思想和情感从意识中排除，人们不应该思考，因为这只会造成疑惑；
>
> 分散注意力，把自己禁锢在外界的印象中，例如童年时期的孩子需要父母在场，因为没有分心，孩子无法忍受自己独立的存在，女性比男性更不依赖认知，因为女性更倾向于分心获得生活安全感。分心使得人们在绝望的边缘提供了安全感，若没有分心物，人们只能承受着内在的痛苦以夜继日；
>
> 锚定机制，这属于现代化社会的构成，人们通过权力机构、宗教仪式、法律秩序、道德伦理等集体主义支柱，这些支柱使得人们能活在高度相似的价值观或理想之中，例如那些创造一番事业的人被偶像化，成为大众追求事业的锚，又或者一个人到了一定岁数被认为应该谈婚论嫁，这些看起来不断重复且刻板的事物，并不只是纯粹对社会文化或秩序的盲从，是构成了社会的顶层构造，然而这些事物迟早都被人民看透其虚构和冗余，人们就会用新的片段去取代他们，例如经济下行和政治动荡导致极右翼政治团体的兴起，地缘政治冲突、逆全球化、全球变暖等外在冲突议题成为到社会秩序的锚定物，如果缺乏这些，人们就陷入社会秩序崩塌的虚无主义危机，而锚定物或多或少构成了当代的激进政治的元素，提倡强烈的社会变革；
>
> 升华，通过创作将生活中的痛苦转换成宝贵的经验，和世间的邪恶作斗争，常见于文学艺术的创作。

> 维克多·弗兰克以他在集中营的经历创造出意义治疗法，包括以下三种方式：
>
> 行动和创作。大部分人都是通过工作获得对自身价值的认同感，寻求功绩或成就，这就是大众普遍认同的“成功”；
>
> 经历或体验的过程。最常见于婚恋和家庭组建，通过承担责任的过程来获取意义；
>
> 受苦。自找苦吃是无法体现苦难本身的，只有是不可抗力的的苦难，人还保持坚定的人性，不抛弃希望，从而找到生命的意义，例如癌症患者接受化疗。

## [AI 和写作](https://lutaonan.com/blog/ai-writing/)

> 写作除了和自己对话以外，增加了和 AI 对话的一层。它可以提供灵感、帮助做 research, 写作风格指导等等的帮助。

> 当你读到很好的作品，你会想去了解作者，这个作者经历的事情，他的思考方式，慢慢地和作者形成一个连结。这是 AI 做不到的。

## [「代码艺术家」不会被 AI 取代](https://lutaonan.com/blog/code-artists/)

> 如果写软件变成了一个只需要花精力在设计而不是实现上的过程，那么写软件的人就是「代码艺术家」了。我觉得「代码艺术家」是不会被 AI 取代的，因为设计的起点和终点都是人类，AI 可以给你 100 个设计上的答案，但只有人类最终能感知到现实和当下的环境和信息，创造出能触动另一群人类的产品。

## [Generative AI’s Act o1](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ais-act-o1/)

> While the actual implementation of Strawberry is a closely guarded secret, the key ideas involve reinforcement learning around the chains of thought generated by the model.

> This leap from pre-trained instinctual responses (”System 1”) to deeper, deliberate reasoning (“System 2”) is the next frontier for AI. It’s not enough for models to simply know things—they need to pause, evaluate and reason through decisions in real time.

> Pre-training LLMs follows a well understood scaling law: the more compute and data you spend on pre-training the model, the better it performs.
>
> The o1 paper has opened up an entire new plane for scaling compute: the more inference-time (or “test-time”) compute you give the model, the better it reasons.

> This shift will move us from a world of massive pre-training clusters toward inference clouds—environments that can scale compute dynamically based on the complexity of the task.

> The messy real world requires significant domain and application-specific reasoning that cannot efficiently be encoded in a general model.
>
> Enter cognitive architectures, or how your system thinks: the flow of code and model interactions that takes user input and performs actions or generates a response.

> There’s an enormous amount of engineering required to turn the raw capabilities of a model into a compelling, reliable, end-to-end business solution.

> Scale AI, which specializes in preparing the vast tracts of data on which the LLMs are trained, teamed up with the Center for AI Safety (CAIS) to launch the initiative, Humanity’s Last Exam. Featuring prizes of $5,000 for those who come up with the top 50 questions selected for the test, Scale and CAIS say the goal is to test how close we are to achieving “expert-level AI systems” using the “largest, broadest coalition of experts in history.”

> So what would a better AI assistant look like? Ideally, it would be easy to summon to the space where you’re already working, such as your inbox or browser. It would see what you see, and incorporate information from that shared context. It would take notes, write documents, populate spreadsheets. It would do the work alongside you, collaborating and iterating as your project evolves.

## [I Like Dumb Plans](https://staysaasy.com/strategy/2024/07/07/i-like-dumb-plans.html)

## [On the Nature of Time](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/10/on-the-nature-of-time/)

> With the traditional mathematical idea of a time coordinate one typically imagines that this coordinate can be “set to any value”, and that then one can immediately calculate the state of the system at that time. But computational irreducibility implies that it’s not that easy. Because it says that there’s often essentially no better way to find what a system will do than by explicitly tracing through each step in its evolution.

> our universe is inevitably full of computational irreducibility which in effect defines a robust notion of the progress of time.

## [“距离主义”](https://tyingknots.net/2024/07/distantism/)

> “距离主义”指的是听觉和视觉这两种远距离感官的特权。许多文化都是在这两种感官近乎垄断的基础上发展起来的，极大伤害了我们。

> “同时失去视觉与听觉，是目前人类所知最严重的身体障碍之一。从本质上来说，这种残障夺走了人体最主要的两种感官，而我们主要通过它们来获取所处世界的认知与信息。它也极大地限制了我们交流的有效性与行动的自由，这些都对于全面而积极的社会参与是必不可少的。”

## [64. 如何从超级信号捕捉超级机会？](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/670e6749db2cf827576fa377)

> 大多数的人周围其实并不认识多少真正的投资的大佬，然后呢，每天被大量的信息噪音所淹没，很难去从中寻找一些真正的有价值的信息，抓住异常值、判断大趋势，抓住属于自己的机会。

> 我觉得现在提穿越周期，其实还说明这个人比较的乐观，这个事还是个周期对吧，有的人就认为完了资本市场要推倒重来了，一级市场已经没有了，美元基金永远没有了，这是个大趋势，已经结束了。

> 有个困惑一样，就是财经媒体到底给这个世界或者是给老百姓，带来了更多的是价值还是噪音？因为它的这个机制，特别到了新媒体时代，它这个机制就不是，平台就不是鼓励你去生产有用的东西，而是鼓励你去生产有流量的东西，并且一直生产。那么一直生产有流量的东西，它往往它提供的有价值的内容就是有限的。
> 也就意味着说，如果你只看财经媒体或者只相信主流叙事，或者只去看别人也看别人也相信的东西，也看别人感兴趣的东西、别人听得懂的东西，那你大概率对于这个世界是没有超而认知的。

> 我今天做的这个内容，到底只是给这个世界创造一点波动，制造一点偏见，还是真的能够帮到某些人。

> 海德格尔他大概有一句话叫做，这个世界本身是构建在闲言上面的。就是这种闲言本身是世界的一部分。

> 真正重要的信息其实是很难漏过的，大的事情很难漏过。其实对大多数人来说，大的信息是很难漏过的，但是最大的坑是，你看到重要的信息之后你打死不承认。

> 今天的人面临着同时发生一件事情，就是说信息的极度过剩和信息的极度匮乏，它同时发生了，它是同质化的信息极度的过剩和多元的信息极度的匮乏。

> 现在是算法时代，每一个人自己也应该有一套自己的算法，自己要有一套闭环的东西。

> 我一定要追踪到原始的，但是大多数的人是习惯用二手信息的。我觉得这个很重要，然后溯源之后，你长期跟踪一些重要的 story、重要的故事、重要的人物、重要的公司和行业，你对它了如指掌，甚至你包括一些小作文出来，你一看那个气味就不对好不好、那个漏款就不对、那个行文就不对，你就是长期培养出这种训练的感觉来。

> 大家都是站在自己的立场里边去强化自己的故事，因为他的立场和他强化他的故事，已经和原本这个事已经没有多少关系了。

> 有的时候不是智力的问题，不是简单认知的问题，还是信息环境的问题。就是我每天碰到什么样的人，他跟我说什么样的话，我的注意力分配给哪些媒体、哪些人，那最终就 you are what you eat, 最终你的认知和你的信息环境。

> 任何一个新的行业，你只要花一个周末的时间，真的，你都建立起一个大概懂一点。然后当你再看到这个领域的动态新闻的时候，你就有感觉了，然后慢慢的一年下来、两年下来、三年下来，当这个领域真的有大机会的时候，你就有感觉了。

## [A Message From the Past (Thoughts on Nostalgia)](https://collabfund.com/blog/a-message-from-the-past-thoughts-on-nostalgia/)

> “The past is more unpredictable than the future.”

> But as Thomas Jefferson said, “How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened.”
>
> Part of the reason nostalgia exists is because, knowing what we do today, we often look back at the past and say, “you really didn’t have much to worry about.” You adapted and moved on. Isn’t that an important lesson as we look ahead?

## [100% user-supported](https://stephango.com/vcware)

## [File over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)

> File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.
>
> File over app is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.

> If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, it’s important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.

## [Solving problem-finding](https://stephango.com/solving-problem-finding)

> Problem-finding is harder than problem-solving because there is no established methodology around it. It’s a hole in our educational system because it leads to people dedicating valuable years of their lives to problems that aren’t particularly important.

> The problem you should solve is the biggest problem you are capable of solving. Perhaps that is why problem finding is such a hard problem in itself — someone needs to care about the problem before it can be found.

## [Scars are beautiful](https://stephango.com/scars)

> I am fascinated by the Japanese philosophy wabi-sabi. It is a worldview centered around the beauty of transience. An example is kintsugi, the art of repairing broken pottery by joining the pieces together with gold lacquer. By doing so, the cracks are accentuated rather than covered up or discarded. The object becomes more valuable as it loses its “perfection”.

> Linus Lee 最近对“委托”发表了一些精彩的见解，我非常喜欢。他的一个片段很好地说明了这一点：
>
> 我有意将界面设计得尽可能不透明。
>
> 他认为，不透明的界面需要一定程度的信任，但一旦建立了这种信任，就可以让你*只需将任务委派给智能体*，而不必进行微观管理。这种异步性质也有助于处理长时间运行的任务——这意味着智能体可以为你做更多的工作。

> 流式聊天
>
> 优点
>
> - 向用户展示一些工作正在进行中
> - 如果流式传输中间步骤，用户可以通过查看内部进展来建立信任
>
> 缺点
>
> - 大多数现有应用程序并不支持流式聊天设计
>
> 非流式聊天
>
> 优点
>
> - 通常用户对即时响应的期望较低，允许智能体承担更多的工作
> - 更多应用程序已经原生支持非流式聊天
>
> 缺点
>
> - 难以了解系统内部发生了什么
> - 需要处理“双重发送”的用户体验，即用户在系统第一次响应完成之前与其再次交互

> 要让智能体在后台运行需要建立一定的信任。如何建立这种信任呢？... 一个简单的方式就是展示给用户智能体正在执行的每一步操作，并让用户随时查看这些信息。... 下一步，不仅仅是让用户看到发生了什么，还要让他们能够纠正智能体的操作。

> 用户从“在循环中”转变为“在循环上”。“在循环上”意味着智能体需要向用户展示其执行的所有中间步骤，用户可以在工作流中途暂停，提供反馈，然后让智能体继续执行。

>
> 久说「我们是通过谈话在抚摸着彼此」，古说「太色了」，并且对「没有做」这件事情感到非常惊讶。想起以前看到的一则广播：
>
> 过度的交流会诱发性欲。因为坦诚所具备的能量是无限巨大的，没有人能够完全承受另一个人的自我剖析，更别提毫无保留地剖析自我。两个人当中总有一方会率先承受不住这种赤裸所带来的不安，这时候人们下意识地就会开始做爱。以及，在倾听的过程中，总会有那么一个瞬间会让人分不清是心疼还是心动。就是这个瞬间，这就是产生性欲的瞬间。

> 你要知道我是一个故事挖掘者，我对于挖掘人内心幽暗的秘密有着深深的着迷。这是不带感情的、理性的旁观，即使投入共情也是为了理解故事本身。我很抽离，所以被这样诡谲的好奇心驱使着，我可以一个人站在百尺地下肆无忌惮地冒犯全人类。我们是文本的盗猎者，只擅长抓住故事最细枝末节的部分进行剥丝抽茧，我们只喜欢高能量的对话，是嗜血的肉食猛禽。

## [向宇宙随便许个愿吧，会有人帮你认真实现的！](https://hayami.typlog.io/hoshi)

> 如果在大厂做一件事情，要经过长期的价值论证、多方牵扯、四方游说，把方案设计得非常完美、把工作量拆分得非常细致。万事俱备、考虑周全，才可以继续推进下去。进一步，如果推进一件小事就如此大费周章，人就很容易被异化成失去自主意识的机器。像是生活在一个充满倦怠的社会，即使意识到不对，也就逆来顺受了。消极、被动、无精打采。
>
> 我有时候觉得自己，好像越来越难发出信号、改变周围的磁场了。犬儒地缩在自己的壳子里，对周围环境失去发挥主观能动性的信心和兴趣。但在无数个「还能这样啊」的冲击里，我觉得需要做出一些改变。向宇宙随随便便许个愿，然后让别人认认真真帮你实现吧！

> 如果对比自建和租卡的话，租三年成本和自建成本差不多。租卡的好处是省心。自建的好处有两个。一是三年后如果 Nvidia 技术还遥遥领先，那么它能控制价格使得 GPU 仍然保值 😭。另一个是自建的数据存储成本低。存储需要跟 GPU 比较近，不管是大云还是小 GPU 云，存储价格都高。但一次模型训练可以用几 TB 空间存 checkpoint，训练数据存储是 10PB 起跳。如果用 AWS S3 的话，10PB 一年两百万。这钱用来自建的话，可以上 100PB。

> 长远来看，通用和垂直模型都得朝着 AGI 去。只是垂直模型可以稍微偏科一点，专业课高分，通用课还行，所以研发成本稍微低一点，研发方式也会不一样点。

## [The New Internet](https://tailscale.com/blog/new-internet)

> I read a post recently where someone bragged about using kubernetes to scale all the way up to 500,000 page views per month. But that’s 0.2 requests per second. I could serve that from my phone, on battery power, and it would spend most of its time asleep. ... The truth is, most things don’t scale, and never need to

> The problem is developers keep scaling things they don’t need to scale, and their lives suck as a result. ... We need to fix that. But how?
> We looked at a lot of options, and talked to a lot of people, and there was an underlying cause for all the problems. The Internet. Things used to be simple. Remember the LAN?

> And HTTPS is fundamentally a centralized system. It has a client, and a server. A dumb terminal, and a thing that does the work. The server has a static IP address, a DNS name, a TLS certificate, and an open port. A client has none of those things. A server can keep doing whatever it wants if all the clients go away, but if the servers go away, a client does nothing.

## [Google vs. Oracle](https://blog.farmostwood.net/944.html)

> API 是一个发送指令的界面，像是汽车的加油踏板（这个例子在第一巡回法院之前关于 Lotus vs. Bortland 的判例里出现过），或者电脑的 QWERTY 键盘。——这两个例子不是随便举的，因为它们都正好反映出这个案子的实质：Google 是利用了现成的 Java 接口以吸引程序员能够迅速上手。这种「利用前人现成的知识节省学习成本」是应该受到保护还是惩罚？加油踏板就是这样一个类似的情况。第一个设计汽车的人已经把加油踏板设计成这样了，如果这种设计本身受到版权保护，每个后来的新的造车厂就都会面临一种两难，它要么继承这种设计但需要支付高昂的版权费用，要么另起炉灶但不会有用户买它的车，因为没人愿意买辆新车还要形成一套新的肌肉记忆。 API 也是这样，判决指出：它的价值很大程度上体现为程序员群体对它的熟练掌握，以及复用这个 API 所能导致的学习成本节省。
>
> 因此，这个判决的核心就是宣布：这种搭便车的做法属于合理应用（fair use），不应该被惩罚。其中最核心的（也是大部分评论最关注的）是这样一段论述：
>
> 「我们必须考量的是：对版权的保护是否促进了公众利益，是否促进了创新。」（第 31 页）
>
> 「考虑到程序员在学习 Java API 上的投资，如果把这个接口本身保护起来，会有害公众利益，因为这会迫使程序员不得不付出额外的努力去适应新的接口。新的创造就会被锁起来，而钥匙掌握在 Oracle 一家手里。这能让 Oracle 获得不菲的利润，但这些利润本来可以流向大量掌握了这些接口的人能创造出的新的应用之中。因此这种锁定是和版权的本意相违背的。」（第 34 页）

> 区块链是一个极端的情形。2016 年，联合广场投资的分析师 Joel Monegro 写了一篇极为著名的文章： fat-protocols。他指出，和传统网络领域里协议很轻而应用很重的情形相反，在区块链的世界里，协议是「胖的」，而应用无足轻重。投资于应用远不如投资协议回报丰厚。

> 我在网上看 ADHD 患者的回忆，​ 发现他们的学习过程和我大相径庭---我上一堂课，老师讲了三个知识点，​ 那么我清楚明白地理解和掌握这三个知识点。他们 ADHD 患者不是这样，他们在课堂走神，因为他们不明白老师讲这三个点有什么意义，也不记不住这三个点究竟是什么。
