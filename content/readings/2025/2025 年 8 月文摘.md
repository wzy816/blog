## [Slow](https://michaelnotebook.com/slow/index.html)

> What problems can human beings only solve over a very long period of time? And how can we build institutions that solve those problems?

## [Reflections on Palantir](https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/reflections-on-palantir) ⭐

> If you wanted to work on these ‘harder’ areas of the economy but also wanted a Silicon Valley work culture, Palantir was basically your only option for awhile.

> In general, as I begin to survey more startups, I find that the talent level at PayPal is not uncommon for a Silicon Valley startup, but the differentiating factor may have been the level of intensity from the top: both Peter Thiel and Max Levchin were extremely intense people - hyper-competitive, hard-working, and unwilling to accept defeat. I think this sort of leadership is what pushes the "standard" talented team to be able to do great things and, subsequently, contributes to producing a wellspring of later achievements.

> Palantir was an unusually intense and weird place. I remember my first time I talked to Stephen Cohen he had the A/C in his office set at 60, several weird-looking devices for minimizing CO2 content in the room, and had a giant pile of ice in a cup.

> I like to meet candidates with no data about them: no résumé, no preliminary discussions or job description, just the candidate and me in a room. I ask a fairly random question, one that is orthogonal to anything they would be doing at Palantir. I then watch how they disaggregate the question, if they appreciate how many different ways there are to see the same thing. I like to keep interviews short, about 10 minutes. Otherwise, people move into their learned responses and you don’t get a sense of who they really are.

> many people have copied the ‘hardcore’ working culture and the ‘this is the Marines’ vibe, but few have the intellectual atmosphere, the sense of being involved in a rich set of ideas. This is hard to LARP - your founders and early employees have to be genuinely interesting intellectual thinkers.

> When I joined, Palantir was divided up into two types of engineers:
>
> Engineers who work with customers, sometimes known as FDEs, forward deployed engineers.
>
> Engineers who work on the core product team (product development - PD), and rarely go visit customers.
>
> ...
> This made the software hard to describe concisely - it wasn’t just a database or a spreadsheet, it was an end-to-end solution to that specific problem, and to hell with generalizability. Your job was to solve the problem, and not worry about overfitting; PD’s job was to take whatever you’d built and generalize it, with the goal of selling it elsewhere.
> ...
> FDEs tend to write code that gets the job done fast, which usually means – politely – technical debt and hacky workarounds. PD engineers write software that scales cleanly, works for multiple use cases, and doesn’t break. One of the key ‘secrets’ of the company is that generating deep, sustaining enterprise value requires both.

> Tyler Cowen has a wonderful saying, ‘context is that which is scarce’, and you could say it’s the foundational insight of this model.

> Why is data integration so hard? The data is often in different formats that aren’t easily analyzed by computers – PDFs, notebooks, Excel files (my god, so many Excel files) and so on. But often what really gets in the way is organizational politics: a team, or group, controls a key data source, the reason for their existence is that they are the gatekeepers to that data source, and they typically justify their existence in a corporation by being the gatekeepers of that data source (and, often, providing analyses of that data).

> The overall ‘vibe’ of the company was more of a messianic cult than a normal software company. But importantly, it seemed that criticism was highly tolerated and welcomed – one person showed me an email chain where an entry-level software engineer was having an open, contentious argument with a Director of the company with the entire company (around a thousand people) cc’d. As a rationalist-brained philosophy graduate, this particular point was deeply important to me – I wasn’t interested in joining an uncritical cult. But a cult of skeptical people who cared deeply and wanted to argue about where the world was going and how software fit into it – existentially – that was interesting to me.

> I’m not sure if they still do this, but at the time when you joined they sent you a copy of Impro, The Looming Tower (9/11 book), Interviewing Users, and Getting Things Done. I also got an early PDF version of what became Ray Dalio’s Principles.
> ...
> But why Impro?
> ...
> Impro is popular with nerds partly because it breaks down social behavior mechanistically.

> One of my favorite insights from Tyler Cowen’s book ‘Talent’ is that the most talented people tend to develop their own vocabularies and memes, and these serve as entry points to a whole intellectual world constructed by that person. Tyler himself is of course a great example of this. Any MR reader can name 10+ Tylerisms instantly - ‘model this’, ‘context is that which is scarce’, ‘solve for the equilibrium’, ‘the great stagnation’ are all examples. You can find others who are great at this. Thiel is one. Elon is another (“multiplanetary species”, “preserving the light of consciousness”, etc. are all memes). Trump, Yudkowsky, gwern, SSC, Paul Graham, all of them regularly coin memes. It turns out that this is a good proxy for impact.
>
> This insight goes for companies, too, and Palantir had its own, vast set of terms, some of which are obscure enough that “what does Palantir actually do?” became a meme online. ‘Ontology’ is an old one, but then there is ‘impl’, ‘artist’s colony’, ‘compounding’, ‘the 36 chambers’, ‘dots’, ‘metabolizing pain’, ‘gamma radiation’, and so on. The point isn’t to explain all of these terms, each of which compresses a whole set of rich insights; it’s that when you’re looking for companies to join, you could do worse than look for a rich internal language or vocabulary that helps you think about things in a more interesting way.

> One of the things that (I think) came from Peter was the idea of not giving people titles. When I was there, everyone had the “forward deployed engineer” title, more or less, and apart from that there were five or six Directors and the CEO. Occasionally someone would make up a different title (one guy I know called himself “Head of Special Situations”, which I thought was hilarious) but these never really caught on. It’s straightforward to trace this back to Peter’s Girardian beliefs: if you create titles, people start coveting them, and this ends up creating competitive politics inside the company that undermines internal unity. Better to just give everyone the same title and make them go focus on the goal instead.

> Some people were more influential than others, but the influence was usually based on some impressive accomplishment, and most importantly nobody could tell anyone else what to do. So it didn’t matter if somebody was influential or thought your idea was dumb, you could ignore them and go build something if you thought it was the right thing to do.

> The cost of this was that the company often felt like there was no clear strategy or direction, more like a Petri dish of smart people building little fiefdoms and going off in random directions. But it was incredibly generative.

> This is an uncomfortable stance for many, precisely because you’re not guaranteed to be doing 100% good at all times. You’re at the mercy of history, in some ways, and you’re betting that (a) more good is being done than bad (b) being in the room is better than not. This was good enough for me. Others preferred to go elsewhere.

## [“Context is that which is scarce”](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/context-is-that-which-is-scarce-2.html)

> When judging people for leadership positions, or for jobs that require strongly synthetic abilities, you should consider how well they are capable of generating an understanding of context across a broad range of domains, including ex nihilo, so to speak.  How to test for understanding of context is itself a topic we could consider in more depth.

## [Lessons from Peter Thiel](https://www.8vc.com/resources/lessons-from-peter-thiel)

> In hiring, value intelligence highly.

> If you are designing something that a customer is going to use or that will represent us in public, it’s not good enough unless it’s flawless and extraordinary.

> Don’t waste time talking about what you plan to think about; instead, work through it immediately.

> So we have to use our judgment to seek out intelligent people who disagree with us — or even intelligent people who have simply taken a different approach — and be open about what we might learn from them.

> In the abstract, this is because the incentives of the other company will not line up with ours, and even if they do for the moment, they no longer will once the situation changes. In specific, other companies don’t have the same culture of execution that Palantir does, and we don’t have the power to instill that culture in them.

> Instead, it’s often instructive to imagine that you were working from a clean slate and design the feature from scratch.

## [You don’t need a niche, you need a point of view](https://thedankoe.com/letters/you-dont-need-a-niche-you-need-a-point-of-view/)

> When you shift from being a repository of specialized knowledge to being a lens through which people see the world, you become a curator of many ideas across different domains and synthesize them under one body of work. You no longer own a category or topic, you own a perspective that creates a unique constellation of interconnected ideas that can’t be replicated because they’re filtered through your specific combination of values, experiences, and goals.

## [CS183: Startup - Peter Thiel Class Notes](https://blakemasters.tumblr.com/)

> We tend to think of all computers as more or less identical. Maybe some features are different, but the systems are mostly homogeneous. People, by contrast, are very different from one another. We look at the wide range of human characteristics—from empathy to cruelty, kindness to sociopathy—and perceive people to be quite diverse. Since people run our legal system, this heterogeneity translates into a wide range of outcomes in disputes. After all, if people are all different, it may matter a great deal who is the judge, jury, or prosecutor in your case. The converse of this super naive intuition is that, since all computers are the same, an automized legal system would be one in which you get the same answer in all sorts of different contexts.

> 普鲁塔克认为，最应该训练和实践的，不是如何规避不幸，而是如何把困境转化为机会。人应当珍惜自己拥有的，好好地使用并从中获得真正的快乐，这样，即便有一天失去了，也能够更加平静地面对。

> 借贷人的“信用”意味着他本来就拥有财富，而既然他有财富，他又何必借贷？因此，避免债务才是最值得奉行的生活准则。

## [Digital hygiene: Notifications](https://herman.bearblog.dev/notifications/)

> Developing a good relationship to your phone is an intentional process. It doesn't happen by accident. All apps and media, by design, are fighting for your attention. I've heard the term "attention economy" thrown around, and I feel like it's an apt description of the battle for our increasingly fractured attentions.

## [对话富达基金张笑牧：如何寻找解决社会问题的 “十倍股”？](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/6892f88646542d8c41bf2169)

> 那其实对于企业来说也是这样的，就说大家在讨论这个企业能不能最终帮股东赚到钱，它其。其实是来自于它的商业化模式，它的货币化模式你就必须要回到根子上去思考怎么样才能够让这个企业持续地赚到钱，那么也就是他的消费者，他的客户就要持续地愿意付他钱，就往前再推一步呢。如果有一个企业他能够为社会上的一些重大的问题去提供一种可持续的解决方案，那么在长期的过程中，那社会就会持续地需要这个企业的服务、产品或者技术。所以在这种情况下，社会的参与者，也就是他的客户，无论是消费者、企业还是政府，就会愿意向他支付一个对价，这个对价其实就是他的是货币化的结果，所以最终我去识别这个可持续成长的这个方法论，就总结为我去找那些能够为社会重要问题提供可持续解决方案的企业，那我觉得他们在长期中就有大概率能够为社会所需要，然后获得社会的回馈，同时他们就有更高的概率去做有较高回报的再投资，然后形成利润层面的、现金流层面的可持续的成长。所以这样的话你可以看出来，就是我所定义的这个可持续的成长，它的这个来龙去脉。

> 其实我们回过头去看电商的话，它其实解决的就是一个信息流、物流、资金流，在一个中国全国化的一个统一大市场这么一个构建的过程中，从 20 年前中国的这个线下零售可能是非常割裂的，完全靠线下渠道商去铺货的模式，到今天基本上在中国任何一个地方生产的产品，你作为消费者你都可以很轻松地从电商上、平台上买到。

> 投入会很高，但是我们也会问他说，那你投入相对高的话，你的 ROI 会是怎么样的？我觉得当时创始人有一句话打动我，说他也无法预测或者给我们一个指引，说它的 ROI 比起端游会高还是低，但是他们做的每一款核心的游戏他都会亲自去玩，他们没有采取当时很盛行的低投入、高周转的这个手游开发模式。那我觉得这也是一种正确的差异化，所以也导致了后来其实他们的手游转型是非常成功的，我觉得他们其实是坚持了他们公司自己的公司文化，没有在一个技术转型的过程中随波逐流，但是他们在面对技术创新的时候又是非常积极去迎接的。

> 那从投研角度来说，情绪价值这个指标的话是不是可以作为一个量化的一个依据呢？因为这方面可能也是大家现在对新消费的投研当中遇到的一个比较大的难题，因为前几年我们在讲科技股的时候还提过市梦率这个词，也是一个比较虚无缥缈的一个市场预期的概念。
>
> 我觉得情绪价值这个东西之所以让投资者这么兴奋，而且它能够突破整个消费疲软的宏观格局，脱颖而出，其实包含了一些非常底层、深层次的人性层面的东西。但是越是这样的东西，你其实是越难量化的。

## [Happiness Research: Get Used to It](https://www.betonit.ai/p/happiness_resea_1html)

> Most of us are familiar with striking examples of people who seem to be adapting well to circumstances that are extremely adverse. We may have seen footage of malnourished children playing happily in garbage dumps or know of severely handicapped people who maintain a cheerful disposition in spite of their disabilities… This chapter examines both the extent and limits of hedonic adaptation — processes that attenuate the long-term emotional or hedonic impact of favorable and unfavorable circumstances.

## [OpenAI's new open-source model is basically Phi-5](https://www.seangoedecke.com/gpt-oss-is-phi-5/)

> As it turns out, it does very well on model benchmarks but disappoints in practice. Searching for the reception to each Phi model shows the same pattern: very impressive benchmarks, lots of enthusiasm, and then actual performance far weaker than the benchmarks would suggest.

> Why would OpenAI train Phi-style models, knowing that they’ll perform better on benchmarks than in real-world applications? For the same reason that Microsoft probably continued to train Phi-style models: safety.

> Why would OpenAI train Phi-style models, knowing that they’ll perform better on benchmarks than in real-world applications? For the same reason that Microsoft probably continued to train Phi-style models: safety.
> ...
> It’s not discussed publically very often, but the main use-case for fine-tuning small language models is for erotic role-play, and there’s a serious demand. Any small online community for people who run local models is at least 50% perverts.

> For OpenAI, it must have been very compelling to train a Phi-style model for their open-source release. They needed a model that beat the Chinese open-source models on benchmarks, while also not misbehaving in a way that caused yet another scandal for them. Unlike Meta, they don’t need their open-source model to be actually good, because their main business is in their closed-source models.

> 我们不是靠头衔或忙碌来定义自己——那些标签一旦消失，你会发现自己其实还在，只是世界一时不太知道怎么「看」你。这种感觉很真实，尤其是当你突然失业、换角色，或者生活按下暂停键的时候
>
> 真正属于自己的东西，比如好奇心、幽默感、看见微小美好的能力，这些不会因为你暂时「无所事事」就消失。

## [崔庆龙\_](https://weibo.com/3762961402/PCUdAqtOx)

> 一个复杂的现象（比如一个人），便是它自身最短的描述。你无法用一个更简单的公式、理论或诊断标签来完全概括它。在这个视角下，任何简化都是一种信息损失，任何预设都会让彼此产生一种被切割了主体完整性的抵抗感。

> 我也让我联想到数字时代的一种困局，也就是网络上出现的越来越多、也越来越简化的人类指称词汇，它将每一个独特的经验个体打包压缩成了非常简洁的指令，这是一种对人类主体性的暴力切割和全然漠视。

> 也就是说，在对一个人的理解上，我们能做到的最大的努力，仅仅是对于一个人内在经验过程的描述，我们越是能做到这一点，就越是能消除人与人之间的隔阂与愤怒。

> What Actually Happened With Each App
> Notion: Built an entire life operating system. Spent three weeks perfecting it. Used it for two days. Now it’s a graveyard of abandoned databases.
>
> Todoist: Great until I realized I was gaming the points system instead of doing actual work. Turns out completing “drink water” 8 times a day doesn’t make you productive.
>
> Things 3: Beautiful. Expensive. Tricked me into thinking I had my life together. But I kept forgetting to check it.
>
> Trello: Turned my todo list into a board with columns. Realized I’m not a startup. I’m just one person trying to remember to buy milk.

## [The Future Isn't Model Agnostic](https://fly.io/blog/the-future-isn-t-model-agnostic/)

> As builders, it’s time we stop hedging our bets and embrace the convergence reality. Every startup pitch deck with ‘model-agnostic’ as a feature should become a red flag for investors who understand product-market fit. Stop putting ‘works with any LLM’ in your one-liner. It screams ‘we don’t know what we’re building.’

## [Why Cursor is About to Ditch Vector Search (and You Should Too)](https://www.tigerdata.com/blog/why-cursor-is-about-to-ditch-vector-search-and-you-should-too)

> Turns out, vector databases actually aren't THE solution for everything. There are inherent limitations and downsides to using/implementing/maintaining vector databases that the industry is finally discovering.
>
> Vector search gives you "most similar" stuff, but not necessarily "most relevant" stuff. This is especially painful when it comes to coding, or any use case that requires specificity.

> Vector search should not be applied to text where semantic similarity is irrelevant.

> For coding, similarity != relevance. Similarity is fuzzy; relevance is precise and exact.

## [Kagi Small Web](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web)

> To begin with, while there is no single definition, “small web” typically refers to the non-commercial part of the web, crafted by individuals to express themselves or share knowledge without seeking any financial gain. This concept often evokes nostalgia for the early, less commercialized days of the web, before the ad-supported business model took over the internet (and we started fighting back!)

## [The small web is beautiful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) ⭐

> However, it’s not just about raw size, but about an “ethos of small”. It’s caring about the users of your site: that your pages download fast, are easy to read, have interesting content, and don’t load scads of JavaScript for Google or Facebook’s trackers. Building a website from scratch is not everyone’s cup of tea, but for those of us who do it, maybe we can promote templates and tools that produce small sites that encourage quality over quantity.

> It’s been said before, but microservices solve a people problem, not a technical one. But beware of Conway’s Law: your architecture will mimic your company structure. Or the reverse – you’ll have to hire and reorg so that your company structure matches the architecture that microservices require: lots of engineers on lots of small teams, with each team managing a couple of microservices.

> 这就是优绩主义的黑暗面：这种残酷的输赢伦理让成功者过于飘飘然，于是他们忘记了那些成功路上的运气因素和助力——家庭、老师、社会阶层、国家和时代。

## [项飙 × 迈克尔·桑德尔：不够幸运的人，怎样过好这一生？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/WoYv_70iuPWgKFFX7uXWLw)

> 不知道我们能否在年轻人中构建一种生活愿景，让他们更加关注当地。这就是为什么我一直在提“附近”——关注你的周围，了解附近的人，你的父母如何生活，谁是你的邻居，谁在清扫你的街道，垃圾是如何被收集的，然后在附近、在触手可及的生活中找到意义，而不是白白做梦。
>
> “你能去到你梦想的任何地方。”不是的，你要知道，你的梦并不真正地属于你自己，它只是霸权在你脑海中的投影。做白日梦的时候，你其实已经在某种程度上成为了霸权的俘虏。真正的自我是在附近、在你与周围人的关系中找到的。

## [Do things that don’t scale, and then don’t scale](https://derwiki.medium.com/do-things-that-dont-scale-and-then-don-t-scale-9fd2cd7e2156)

> A little over a decade ago, Paul Graham popularized “Do things that don’t scale.” The idea was: at first, you do the scrappy, personal, labor-intensive stuff just to get traction… and then you figure out how to make it huge.

> But with GPT-assisted coding, I think we’re in an era where you can just stop after the first part. You can do something that doesn’t scale — and leave it that way. That might actually be the best version of it.
>
> The cost to build is so low now.

> Some things work precisely because they’re small.

> The version that only works for my mom is the safest — and best — version.

> The Pattern
> • See a need that matters to you.

> The real luxury of building with today’s tools isn’t speed, or cost, or even the magic of AI — it’s the freedom to stop.

> My favourite word in the German language is Gegenstand, for object or thing.
>
> Gegenstand, “stand-against”. An object is something that stands against you. It’s not you. It’s outside you. It has its own rules. It doesn’t conform to your desires. You run up against it, and it resists.
>
> Objects aren’t just inert stuff – they do something. Even better, Gegenstand shows how objects help define us. I know what I am, what the limits of myself are, because I am able to come up against resistant objects. That’s how I know and have a sense of my own body, its extension in space, where it ends and where the world begins.

> I am able to have a self in the first place only because the world of objects is there to stand against me.

> The problem is that the release was so botched that OpenAI is now experiencing a Reverse DeepSeek Moment – all the forces that caused us to overreact to DeepSeek’s r1 are now working against OpenAI in reverse.
>
> This threatens to give Washington DC and its key decision makers a very false impression of a lack of AI progress, especially progress towards AGI, that could lead to some very poor decisions, and it could do the same for corporations and individuals.

> We had the DeepSeek Moment because of a confluence of factors misled people:
>
> The ‘six million dollar model’ narrative gave a false impression on cost.
> They offered a good clean app with visible chain of thought, it went viral.
> The new style caused an overestimate of model quality.
> Timing was impeccable, both in order of model releases and within the tech tree.
> Safety testing and other steps were skipped, leaving various flaws, and this was a pure fast follow, but in our haste no one took any of that into account.
> A false impression of ‘momentum’ and stories about Chinese momentum.
> The ‘always insist open models will win’ crowd amplified the vibes.

> 计划的核心是做好三件事：财务、心理、家人。
>
> 其中财务上的准备是最容易量化和执行的，也往往是第一步；心理建设则更复杂，它要求你直面内心、严守纪律、破除障碍，是第二步；至于家人的支持，每个家庭的情况都不同，几乎无法借鉴他人经验，只能靠自己去摸索与沟通。

> 对于本金的积累，大多数人都是通过自己的“人力资本”来换“金融资本”，通俗的讲就是上班赚钱。而人力资本最值钱的时候，是在 40 岁之前。在新兴且需要终身学习的行业，这个年龄界限往往还会提前，可能到 35 岁左右。

> 可一旦你开始 FIRE，离开工作岗位，当门禁失效、工位被收回、企业微信注销，外界对你的态度也会随之改变。你不再被拜托帮忙，聚会中也不再是焦点，甚至本来经常联系的人也渐渐沉默，很多人此时会疑惑：我到底是谁？我还算什么？
>
> 一个人的价值不能只被工作定义，工作之外的你，也需要有自我认同和心理调节的能力。否则，一旦身份标签被剥离，内心很容易陷入失落与迷茫。

> 每个人想要的退休生活都不相同，但大概率是想摆脱他人的要求、期望，回归自己的热爱：

> Sometimes I’m convinced there’s a note taped to my back that says, “PLEASE SPILL YOUR SOUL UPON THIS WOMAN.” I am not a therapist, nor in any way certified to deal with emotional distress, yet my presence seems to cause people to regurgitate their traumas.
>
> This quirk of mine becomes especially obvious when dating. Many of my dates turn into pseudo-therapy sessions, with men sharing emotional traumas they’ve kept bottled up for years. One moment I’m learning about his cat named Daisy, and then half a latte later, I’m hearing a detailed account of his third suicide attempt, complete with a critique of the food in the psychiatric ward.

## [How AI researchers accidentally discovered that everything they thought about learning was wrong](https://nearlyright.com/how-ai-researchers-accidentally-discovered-that-everything-they-thought-about-learning-was-wrong/) ⭐

> Five years ago, suggesting that AI researchers train neural networks with trillions of parameters would have earned you pitying looks. It violated the most fundamental rule in machine learning: make your model too large, and it becomes a glorified photocopier, memorising training data whilst learning nothing useful.
>
> This wasn't mere convention—it was mathematical law, backed by three centuries of statistical theory. Every textbook showed the same inexorable curve: small models underfit, optimal models generalise, large models catastrophically overfit. End of story.

> For over 300 years1, one principle governed every learning system: the bias-variance tradeoff. The mathematics was elegant, the logic unassailable. Build a model too simple, and it misses crucial patterns. Build it too complex, and it memorises noise instead of signals.

> The models didn't collapse. After an initial stumble where they appeared to memorise their training data, something extraordinary occurred. Performance began improving again. Dramatically.
>
> The phenomenon earned the name "double descent"—first the expected rise in error as models overfit, then an unexpected second descent as they somehow transcended overfitting entirely. Mikhail Belkin and his colleagues, who documented this discovery, noted it "contradicts conventional wisdom derived from bias-variance analysis."

> Hidden within every large network, they found "winning tickets"—tiny subnetworks that could match the full network's performance. They could strip away 96% of parameters without losing accuracy. The vast majority of every successful network was essentially dead weight.
>
> But here lay the crucial insight: these winning subnetworks only succeeded with their original random starting weights. Change the initial values, and the same sparse architecture failed completely.

> The lottery ticket hypothesis crystallised: large networks succeed not by learning complex solutions, but by providing more opportunities to find simple ones.
> ...
> Training becomes a massive lottery draw, with the best-initialised small network emerging victorious whilst billions of others fade away.

> this reframes intelligence itself.
> ...
> Intelligence isn't about memorising information—it's about finding elegant patterns that explain complex phenomena. Scale provides the computational space needed for this search, not storage for complicated solutions.

> For AI development, this understanding suggests both promise and limits. Scaling works because larger models provide more lottery tickets, more chances to find optimal solutions. But this mechanism implies natural bounds. As networks become more successful at finding minimal solutions, additional scale yields diminishing returns.
>
> This aligns with expert concerns about current approaches' limits. Yann LeCun argues that fundamental architectural constraints may prevent language models from achieving true understanding regardless of scale.

> The accidental discovery that revolutionised AI offers a profound lesson: the universe often holds elegant surprises for those bold enough to test conventional wisdom's boundaries.

> We refer to the systematic mapping of data, logic, and action to meaningful semantic concepts as an “ontology.” Organizations benefit from building and using an Ontology to organize and leverage their data, enabling connectivity at scale to view local decisions in a more global context, interpretability for more robust and effective analysis, economies of scale with the ability to build entire applications and use cases in the existing Ontology, decision capture through write back actions made in-platform to original source systems, and operational AI/ML directly in-platform.
